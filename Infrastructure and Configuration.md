- You want to monitor a metric to set the number of nodes.
- You want to increase or decrease the number of pods depending on queue of nodes.
- You want to monitor the number of nodes to auto-set the number of pods.

13. You are tasked with making multiple deployments against a particular resource group in Azure CLI. However, when you attempt to make the deployments you receive the "DeploymentQuotaExceeded" error code. What can you do within the CLI to fix this issue?

- Delete entries from your history that are no longer needed with the az group deployment delete command.    ( Correct )
- Delete entries from your history that are no longer needed with the Remove-AzResourceGroupDeployment command.
- Implement new empty entries in your history with the New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment command.
- Implement new empty entries in your history with the az group deployment create command.

14. An Azure policy has default built-in policies. Which naming pattern ensures that resource names match the naming convention?

- Require like pattern
- Require tag like pattern
- Allow multiple name pattern
- Require match pattern    ( Correct )

15. You want to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with advanced networking using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. What is required to deploy advanced networking?

- Open GitHub and apply the Credentials and Crucial parameters.
- Apply all default JSON parameters.
- Create a service principal (SP) and use the SP's Application ID, Object ID, and Secret parameters.   ( Correct )

16. You are using Azure PowerShell with Azure Storage to create and manage your resources from the command line. You create a storage account and name it "MainStorage," but Azure is not allowing you to use this name. What is the most likely reason for this issue?

- The name must contain a period (.)
- The name must be all uppercase.
- The name must be all lowercase.      ( Correct )
- The name must contain a hyphen (-).

17. You are assigning a public IP address to a virtual machine using an ARM template. You name the "domainNameLabel" property for your public IP address "MainDomain." Why is Azure not allowing you to use this name?

- The name must be all lowercase.      ( Correct )
- The name must contain a period (.)
- The name must be all uppercase.

18. You are going through the process of creating multiple Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks using an Azure Resource Manager Template. After you finish creating the Virtual Machines you decide to resize one of your VM's disks but receive a "Conflict" error. What is the most likely explanation of this error?

- Disk resizing is only allowed when creating a Virtual Machine, or the Virtual Machine is deallocated.     ( Correct )
- A Virtual Machine within the group already has this size therefore the operation cannot be completed.
- Disk resizing is not allowed in the region or cluster that your VM is located in.
- Disk is unsuccessful because the cluster or region doesn't have resources available, you will have to wait for resources to clear up on the shared resource pool.
